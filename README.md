The Zen of ZSH but using Oh My Posh instead of Powerlevel10K

To use this on a new Debian system you need to install the following:
- Oh My Posh (using the instructions at https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/installation/linux. The sh at the end of the installation command doesn't need sudo!)
- - Once oh-my-posh is installed you need to manually create ~/.config/oh-my-posh and copy the relevant theme file to this folder.
- Git (apt install git)
- Unzip (apt install unzip)
- zoxide (using the instructions on the Github page (the sh and the end of the installation command doesn't need sudo!)
- fzf (need to download the latest binary from the Github page and manually copy to /usr/bin and change permissions to 755 and ownership to root:root)
